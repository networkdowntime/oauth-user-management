# TODO:

- Add a Scopes View page
- Role list shows User counts, need to add Service Account counts
- Change Scopes Edit from a modal to a page, should let you add/remove the scope from service accounts like we do for Role Edit
- Chips on View Users, View Service Accounts for Roles & Scopes should be clickable links.
